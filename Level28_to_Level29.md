-  In this level all we need to do is to clone a git repository and read the password inside it
- We clone the repository using the command: ```git clone ssh://bandit28-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit28-git/repo```
- The password for the repository is same as the password for the ```bandit28``` user
- We then navigate inside the repo
- There is a ```README.md``` file that has the password, however it has been masked
- But since it is version controlled, we just checkout one previous version and boom! we have the password ready
- Obtained password: 4pT1t5DENaYuqnqvadYs1oE4QLCdjmJ7
