- In this level all we need to do is to clone a git repository and read the password inside it
- We clone the repository using the command: ```git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit27-git/repo```
- The password for the repository is same as the password for the ```bandit27``` user
- We then navigate inside the repo and find the password
- Obtained password: Yz9IpL0sBcCeuG7m9uQFt8ZNpS4HZRcN
