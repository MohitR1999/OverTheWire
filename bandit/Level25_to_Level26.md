- For cracking this level, we need to get a shell for user ```bandit26```, which has been disabled by default
- First we read the ```/etc/passwd``` file as the user ```bandit25```, to find out what shell is being used by the user ```bandit26```
- We find that a file named ```text.txt``` is being read by ```more``` command inside the script specified by the ```/etc/passwd``` file for the user. But, if our terminal window is large, ```more``` command doesn't go in interactive mode and hence we can't do anything
- To work around this, we shrink the terminal window to a small size, forcing ```more``` to go in interactive mode
- From there, we open ```vim``` by running ```v``` command directly. This opens up the ```vim``` editor and we can launch a shell from there
- First, we set the default shell for the user by running ```set shell=/bin/bash``` inside ```vim```
- Now we execute command ```:shell``` to get the ```bash``` shell
- Once we get the shell, we have the password for level 26
- We also run the ```bandit27-do``` setuid binary in order to get the password for level 27
- Obtained password for ```bandit26```: s0773xxkk0MXfdqOfPRVr9L3jJBUOgCZ
