-  In this level we need to do is to clone a git repository and push some changes upstream
- We clone the repository using the command: ```git clone ssh://bandit31-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit31-git/repo```
- The password for the repository is same as the password for the ```bandit31``` user
- We then navigate inside the repo
- There is a ```README.md``` file that tells us what to do
- We create a file called ```key.txt``` with the content specified in the ```README```
- We then need to remove this file from ```.gitignore``` in order to be tracked by git and pushed to the master branch
- We then add these changes to the staging area, do a commit and push the changes
- The remote server does a pre-commit check, gives us the password and rejects the pushed changes
